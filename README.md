# AmbientInventoryManagement
[Subnautica](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki) game mod.

It's purpose is to make inventory management little harder and more realistic.
Inventory size of some items is too small comparing to their 3D models. Like [Power Cell](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Cell)  is much bigger than [Battery](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Battery) but in inventory it takes the same amount of space: 1x1.
This mod increases inventory size of some 1x1 items:
* Power Cell - 1x2
* Ion Power Cell - 1x2
* Fire Extinguisher - 1x2
* LED Light - 1x3
* Beacon - 1x2

## Requirements
* [QMods Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/201) mod
* [SMLHelper mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113) 2.1 and above
