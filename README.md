# AmbientInventoryManagement
Subnautica game mod.

It's purpose is to make inventory management little harder and more realistic.
Inventory size of some items is too small comparing to their 3D models. Like PowerCell is much bigger than Battery but in inventory it takes the same amount of space: 1x1.
This mod increases inventory size of some 1x1 items:
* Power Cell - 1x2
* Ion Power Cell - 1x2
* Fire Extinguisher - 1x2
* LED Light - 1x3
* Beacon - 1x2
